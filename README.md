# NeoWiki

AI-ready knowledge management system that combines collaborative editing and knowledge graph.

## Technical Documentation

See [docs/](./docs/), especially [docs/Glossary.md](./docs/glossary.md).

REST API docs, including OpenAPI, will be created at some point. Till then, look for "RestRoutes" in [extension.json](extension.json).

## Development

### NeoWiki frontend

Initial setup: run `make ts-install ts-build` to install the dependencies and build the frontend code.

For other actions, refer to the `ts-*` commands in the [Makefile](./Makefile).
