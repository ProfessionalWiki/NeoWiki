Claude Monet was a French painter and founder of Impressionist painting. He is seen as a key precursor to Modernism, especially in his later series paintings of water lilies, haystacks, and the Rouen Cathedral.

Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons.
