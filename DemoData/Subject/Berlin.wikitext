<div class="neowiki-infobox" data-subject-id="s1demo2sssssss1"></div>

Because NeoWiki supports adding as many Subjects as you want to a single page, it is possible to emulate Wikibase Statements.

We did not optimize for this use case yet. In particular, the required Subject title field (first column in the table)
does not make sense for such statements. Even so, this page demonstrates the core capability.

{{#table:Population}}

Neo4j has excellent native support for properties on relations. NeoWiki already supports this in its backend, but we
do not have a UI for it yet. Properties on relations are perfect for when the qualified value is a subject. For instance,
if you have a Person (ie John Doe) that Works For (property) a Company (ie Professional Wiki), their "Works For" relation
could have start date, end date, and compensation properties.
