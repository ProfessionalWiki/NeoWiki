NeoWiki follows the Property Graph model.

NeoWiki Subjects have NeoWiki Statements that are simple property value pairs. Unlike Wikibase Statements,
the data model does not force the presence of Qualifiers, References, and Rank.

Because NeoWiki supports adding as many Subjects to a single page, it is possible to emulate Wikibase Statements.
You do this by adding one Subject for what would have been a Wikibase Statement. This has the additional benefit
that your Wikibase Statement equivalent has a Schema, which allows you to force said equivalent into a specific
shape. For instance, you can require that your Population records have a Date, a Measurer, and a list of References.

We did not optimize for this use case yet. In particular, nice UIs are missing, such as showing the Population
data in an (editable) table.
