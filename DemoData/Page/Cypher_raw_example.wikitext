This page demonstrates the <code>cypher_raw</code> parser function for executing read-only Cypher queries against the Neo4j graph database.

The parser function allows you to query the graph database and display the raw JSON results directly on a wiki page.

== Basic Query Example ==

Query all companies in the database:

{{#cypher_raw: MATCH (n:Company) RETURN n.label, n.id LIMIT 5}}

== Query with Filtering ==

Find companies founded after 2018:

{{#cypher_raw: MATCH (n:Company) WHERE n.founded_at > 2018 RETURN n.label, n.founded_at}}

== Query with Relations ==

Find companies and their products:

{{#cypher_raw: MATCH (company:Company)-[:Has_product]->(product:Product) RETURN company.label, product.label LIMIT 10}}

== Notes ==

* Only read-only queries are allowed. Write operations like <code>CREATE</code>, <code>SET</code>, <code>DELETE</code> are rejected.
* Query results are displayed as formatted JSON.
* This is a demo feature for exploring the graph database structure.
* For more complex data visualization, use the standard NeoWiki Subject display features.
