This page demonstrates the <code>cypher_raw</code> parser function for executing Cypher queries against the Neo4j graph database.

This is a '''demo feature''' for the NeoWiki proof of concept demo. It will not be present as-is in a production version.

== Basic Query Example ==

Query all companies in the database:

{{#cypher_raw: MATCH (n:Company) RETURN n.label, n.id LIMIT 5}}

== Query with Filtering ==

Find companies founded after 2018:

{{#cypher_raw: MATCH (n:Company) WHERE n.founded_at > 2018 RETURN n.label, n.founded_at}}

== Query with Relations ==

Find companies and their products:

{{#cypher_raw: MATCH (company:Company)-[:Has_product]->(product:Product) RETURN company.label, product.label LIMIT 10}}

== Notes ==

* Only read-only queries are allowed. Write operations like <code>CREATE</code>, <code>SET</code>, <code>DELETE</code> are rejected.
* Query results are displayed as formatted JSON.
