## Technical Documentation

These docs are aimed at developers working on or interfacing with NeoWiki.

Key docs:
* [Glossary](Glossary.md) - Definitions NeoWiki concepts. We use these as Ubiquitous Language (UI, code, docs, etc)
* [Architecture Decision Records](adr/)
* [Planning docs](planning/) - Work-in-progress exploration and discussion documents

REST API docs, including OpenAPI, will be created at some point. Till then, look for "RestRoutes" in [extension.json](../extension.json).
