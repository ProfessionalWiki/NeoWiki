# Store Data as JSON

Date: March 2023

Status: Accepted

## Context

We need to store structured data that can be viewed and edited in wiki pages.

Semantic MediaWiki stores the data in wikitext and Wikibase stores the data in JSON.

## Decision

Store the data in JSON.

## Consequences

Pros:

* All values can be edited, since they cannot be generated by wikitext. We can thus allow editing of query results.
* JSON is easier to parse and generate than wikitext.
* We can accurately see historical values in the revision history.

Cons:

* No out-of-the-box user scripting. Users cannot use wikitext templates, functions, etc. to generate values.
